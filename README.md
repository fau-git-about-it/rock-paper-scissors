#rock-paper-scissors 

The task will be to make a simple rock paper scissors game against the computer, in which there will be five rounds and the winner announced at the end of the five rounds.

This is my second project from theOdinProject!

Front end development will be added in later 

(EDIT August 08, 2020): 

Added basic user interface for the front-end. Changed the game from playing only 5 rounds to playing until whomever reaches 5 first. Learned how to apply Document Model Object methods to have the user click on buttons rather than typing a choice through the window prompt, and along the way removed the console.log(s) of each round's winner and the final winner. 

Along with accessing nodes through Javascript I became more knowledgable in maniuplating the design to change based on conditions and events firing. Alot more work needs to be done until the project is finished, by this is a good step for me in the proper direction.
